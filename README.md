## IAM & Aws CLI <a name="IAM"></a>
Identity and Access Management, is:

```
Global service
Root account is created by default
User is individual, can be grouped
Groups only contain users, not other groups
Policies = Json with permissions == Users or Groups
Least privilege principle
Inline Policie = permission direct to one user
```

CloudShell:
```
is the terminal in the Management Console
all the functionalities of Aws CLI
```

Roles:
```
Usuários que performam serviços precisam de permissões, a melhor prática é criar um Role.
Common roles:
	Ec2 Instances Role
	Lambda function
	Roles for CloudFormation
```

Security Tools:
```
IAM Credentials Report (account-level):
	lists all your account's users and thestatus of their credentials
	Audit permissions

IAM Access Advisor (user-level):
	Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
	Great to revise policies.
```

Best Practices:
```
Não utilizar a root account.
Um usuario físico = um usuário aws
Strong password policy + MFA
Create Roles for giving permissions to Aws services
AccessKEys for Programmatic Access(CLI/SDK)
```

## EC2 <a name="EC2"></a>
Is one of the most popular of Aws' offering
EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud - Infra as a Service:
```
Virtual  machines - EC2
Storing data on virtual drives - EBS
Distributing load across machines - ELB
Scaling the services using ASG(auto-scaling group)
```

EC2 sizing & Configuration options:
```
OS: linux, windows ow Mac OS
Compute power & cores  (CPU)
random-access memry (RAM)
Storage space:
	EBS & EFS - Network-attached
	Ec2 Instance Store - Hardware
Public Ip address
Firewal rules - Security group
Bootstrap script: User Data
```

EC2 User Data
```
Bootstrap our instance using an Ec2 User data script
Bootstrapping = running commands when machine starts
				executado uma vez quando a instancia inicia
				Install updates / softwares / common files from the internet
				run with root user
```

Instance Types
```
Naming convention: m5.2xlarge
				   m: instance class
				   5: generation
				   2xlarge: size within the instance class

General purpose: Balance with Compute x Memory x Networking
Compute optimized: possibilidade de alta performance de processamento como Media transcoding/high performance webservers/
				   high performance computing (HPC) / Scientific modeling & machine learning / dedicated gaming servers
				   C.
Memory Optimized
Storage Optimized: High, sequential read and write access to large data
```

Security Group:
```
Are the fundamental of network security in Aws.
Controll how traffic isallowed into or out of our EC2 
only contain ALLOW RULES
can reference by IP or others SG
They Regulate:
			Access to Ports
			Authorised IP ranges -Ipv4/6
			Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) - BLOCKED BY DEFAULT
			Control of outbount network (from the instance to the world) - AUTHORISED BY DEFAULT
			Can be attached to MULTIPLE instances
			Locked down to a region /VPC combination
			Does live "outside" the EC2
			It's good to maitain one separate SG for  ssh access

Classic Ports to know:
	22 = SSH ( Secure Shell ) - log into a Linux instance
	21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
	80 = HTTP - access unsecure websites
	443 = HTTPS - access secure websites
	3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instance
```

SSH  Summary Table:
```
SSH is a utilitary command tools to connect into instances
Putty is availabily for Windows <10
Is one of  the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command line. 
EC2 Instance Connect works to connect by the console
```

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
```
On-Demand Instances: short workloads, predictable pricing
					 Pay for what you use:
						Linux - billing per second, after the first minute
						all other - billing per hour
					 Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
					 No long-term commitment
					 Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads
					 

Reserved: Min 1 YEAR
		Reserved Instances: long workloads, like DB
								Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand
								Reservation period: 1 year = +discount || 3 years = +++ discount
								Specific instance type	

		Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
										can change the EC2 instance type
										Up to 54% discount

		Schedule Reserved Instances: every Thursday between 3 ad 6 pm during 1 year.
	
Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable - menos confiáveis)
				you can "lose" at any poitn of time 
				Discount of up to 90%
				The MOST cost-efficient instances
				Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure:
					batch jobs / Data analysis / Image processing / flexible starts and end
				NOT GREAT FOR CRITICAL JOBS
				Max spot price:get the instance while current spot price < max you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 min grace period.
				Spot Block: block sport instance ruing a specified time frame(1 to 6h) without interruptions
				How to terminate?
					First cancel  a Spot Requests, and then terminate the associated Spot Instance
					Only cancel Spot Instance requests that are OPEN, ACTIVE or DISABLED.

Spot Fleets: set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
			 will try to meet the target capacity with price contraints
			 Define possible launch pools
			 Stops lauching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
			 Strategies to allocate:
			 	lowestPrice: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workloads)
				diversified: distributed acrossall pools (great for availability, long worklads)
				capcaityOptimized: pool with the  optimal capacity for the number of instances
			 Allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price

Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control isntance placement
				 Is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
				 Compliance requirements and use existing software licenses
				 3 year period reservation
				 more expensive
				 BYOL - Bring your own license

Dedicated Instances: instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
					 may share hardware
					 no control over instance placement, can move hardware afterstop/start
